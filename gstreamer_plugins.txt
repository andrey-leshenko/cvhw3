Sometimes the following error occurs:


OpenCV Error: Unspecified error (GStreamer: your gstreamer installation is missing a required plugin
) in handlemessage, file /home/andrey/bin/OpenCV/modules/videoio/src/cap_gstreamer.cpp, line 1692
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'cv::Exception'
  what():  /home/andrey/bin/OpenCV/modules/videoio/src/cap_gstreamer.cpp:1692: error: (-2) GStreamer: your gstreamer installation is missing a required plugin
   in function handlemessage

The solution is to install the required plugin. It is one of:
- gstreamer-*
- gstreamer1-*

In the future we will figure which one exactly it is.
